# converter_for_me

## Overview
As I prepare to move to the USA from India, I realized that gyms in the USA typically use pounds as the unit of measurement for weights, whereas in India, we commonly use kilograms. To ease my transition and help myself and others like me, I created this **Converter for me** using Flutter.

The app allows users to enter their weight in pounds, and it instantly converts it to kilograms, providing a seamless way to understand and communicate weight measurements in different units.
