# converter_for_me

## Overview
As I prepare to move to the USA from India, I realized that gyms in the USA typically use pounds as the unit of measurement for weights, whereas in India, we commonly use kilograms. To ease my transition and help myself and others like me, I created this **Converter for me** using Flutter.

The app allows users to enter their weight in pounds, and it instantly converts it to kilograms, providing a seamless way to understand and communicate weight measurements in different units.

## Features
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Instantly converts weight from pounds to kilograms.
- Easy-to-use text input for weight entry.

4. Run the app on your preferred simulator or physical device.
5. Enter your weight in pounds in the provided text field.
6. The app will automatically display your weight converted to kilograms.
